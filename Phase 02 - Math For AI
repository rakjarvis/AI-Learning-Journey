LINEAR ALGEBRA (GEOMETRY OF MODELS)

Scalars, vectors, matrices
Vector spaces & span
Dot product = projection
Norms & distance
Matrix multiplication = composition of transformations
Rank & information
Eigenvalues (why directions matter)
Embeddings as geometry
Similarity & cosine distance

PROBABILITY (UNCERTAINTY ENGINE)

Probability axioms
Random variables
Distributions (discrete & continuous)
Expectation & variance
Joint / marginal / conditional
Bayes theorem (deep intuition)
Likelihood vs probability
Noise & randomness
Sampling & estimation
Entropy & cross-entropy
Bias–variance tradeoff
