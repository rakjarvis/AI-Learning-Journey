Questions Every Project Must Answer

Why this model and not simpler alternatives?
What assumptions are you making (and how can they break)?
Where does it fail, and why?
How do you know it’s working (and staying working)?
What happens under distribution shift / data drift?
What are latency, cost, and reliability trade-offs?
How would you improve it with the next 2 weeks of work?
How would you deploy and operate it at scale safely?
